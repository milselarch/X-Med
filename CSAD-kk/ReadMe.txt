Regarding forum
==============
1) The screenshots shows an error that is only displayed if you are logged in to the forum. I am 
    not sure what the problem is exactly, but i think its about using the "isset" and not initialising the
    'uid' like so; $uid = ""; .

-Use those to acess "Bannersnack". I have an acount created there and there is a flashbanner
inside you can export. Also, you can make changes easily if you wanna make them.
