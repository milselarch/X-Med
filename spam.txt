create table medicine (
    name varchar(128) not null primary key,
    instructions text not null
    )
    
no need to create seperate ID (initital plan) from medicine name, since meidcine name
should be unique anyways

QR can be dynamically generated from medicine_name, so no need to store it in server

IF EXISTS (SELECT * FROM medicine where medicine_name = ?)
    UPDATE medicine SET instructions = ? WHERE medicine_name = ?
ELSE
    INSERT INTO medicine VALUES (?, ?);
    
INSERT INTO table VALUES(?, ?) ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE instructions = ?;

CREATE USER 'webuser'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
GRANT alter,delete,index,insert,select,update ON X_Med.* TO 'webuser'@'localhost'

Hey guys, this folder has all the code for the X-Med website

SQL table for X-Med was made using:
create table medicine (
    name varchar(128) not null primary key,
    instructions text not null
    )

I used user "webuser" to access the sql database from php. if you're lazy you could change it to root in the 3 .php files. Otherwise create user webuser as follows: 
CREATE USER 'webuser'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
GRANT alter,delete,index,insert,select,update ON X_Med.* TO 'webuser'@'localhost'


jesus christ when I opened up awseducate in firefox it showed me I had 0 time left - thought I had reset it again but opening on google chrome displayed everything correctly.
